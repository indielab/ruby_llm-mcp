It's also intended to be used as a resource.\n\nIn summary, I have the content of three files, all of which appear to be intended for use as resources, possibly served by some kind of content management or deployment system.  The `test.txt` file provides a hint that an MCP system might be involved, and mentions a caching mechanism.\n"
