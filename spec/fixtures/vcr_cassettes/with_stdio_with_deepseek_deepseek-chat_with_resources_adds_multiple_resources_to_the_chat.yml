        the provided resources, I have the following information:\n\n### 1. **test.txt**  \n   -
        **Description**: A text file  \n   - **Content**:  \n     ```\n     Hello,
        this is a test file!\n     This content will be served by the MCP resource.\n     You
        can modify this file and it will be cached for 5 minutes.\n     ```  \n   -
        **Key Notes**:  \n     - Served by the MCP (likely a resource server).  \n     -
        Modifications are cached for 5 minutes.  \n\n### 2. **second_file.txt**  \n   -
        **Description**: A second text file  \n   - **Content**:  \n     ```\n     This
        is the second file that I want to be able to use as a resource\n     ```  \n   -
        **Purpose**: Intended to be used as a resource (similar to `test.txt`).  \n\n###
        3. **my.md**  \n   - **Description**: A markdown file  \n   - **Content**:  \n     ```markdown\n     #
        My Markdown File\n\n     This is a markdown file that I want to be able to
        use as a resource\n\n     ## Section 1\n\n     This is a section in my markdown
        file\n\n     ## Section 2\n\n     This is another section in my markdown file\n     ```  \n   -
        **Structure**:  \n     - Main heading (`#`).  \n     - Two subsections (`##
        Section 1`, `## Section 2`).  \n   - **Purpose**: Also intended for use as
        a resource.  \n\n### Observations:  \n- All files (`test.txt`, `second_file.txt`,
        `my.md`) are meant to be served as resources, possibly by the \"MCP resource\"
        mentioned in `test.txt`.  \n- `test.txt` hints at a caching mechanism (5-minute
        cache duration).  \n- No explicit relationship between the files is described,
        but they share the common goal of being reusable resources.  \n\nLet me know
        if you''d like further analysis (e.g., parsing the markdown, extracting metadata,
        or simulating the caching behavior)!"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":142,"completion_tokens":432,"total_tokens":574,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":142},"system_fingerprint":"fp_8802369eaa_prod0425fp8"}'
